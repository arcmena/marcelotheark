  <p>
    I am a Frontend developer based in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
    <br />
    <br />
    Have been developing user experiences for over two and a half years now,
    working from financial to health sectors, building new apps and landing
    pages using the best development tools and practices.
    <br />
    <br />
    Iâ€™m passionate about creating the best user experiences, using ui/ux
    thinking, developing, documenting and implementing design systems.
    <br />
    <br />
    Have worked with MVC pattens with C#, implementing view templates and logic
    with vanilla JavaScript and JQuery, but in the last two years Iâ€™ve been in
    love with React and the way it allows the developer to create the structure
    he needs for each project in a clean way.
